# Production Docker Compose Override
# Usage: docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
#
# This file removes development-only services and configures for production:
# - Uses internal networking only (no localhost ports exposed)
# - Requires external reverse proxy for UI access
# - Enables stricter security settings

version: '3.8'

services:
  # Remove port exposures - use reverse proxy instead
  db:
    ports: []
  
  control-api:
    ports: []
    environment:
      - RUST_LOG=warn
  
  ui:
    ports: []
  
  prometheus:
    ports: []
  
  grafana:
    ports: []
  
  # Add TLS termination via reverse proxy (nginx, traefik, etc.)
  # Example nginx config would handle:
  # - HTTPS termination
  # - Rate limiting
  # - WebSocket support for UI
  # - Access logging
